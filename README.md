# Rejoice Marutsi — Data Scientist

I'm Rejoice, a recent Data Science graduate. I build predictive models and data-driven solutions that help decision-making in healthcare and finance.

## About
I have experience with data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluating classification models. I work mainly with Python (pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost) and Jupyter notebooks.

## Projects

### Diabetic Readmission Prediction Model
- Goal: Predict whether a patient is likely to be readmitted within 30 days.
- Key steps: EDA, missing-value handling, categorical encoding, feature engineering, model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), hyperparameter tuning.
- Example results: XGBoost (best) — ROC AUC ≈ 0.82 (example).
- Code & Notebook: https://github.com/reneymay2304/rmarutsi.github.io/blob/main/DIABETIC%20PATIENT%20READMISSION%20PREDICTION%20MODEL.ipynb



### Loan Approval Prediction Model
- Goal: Predict whether a loan application should be approved.
- Key steps: Data cleaning, imputation, scaling, handle class imbalance (SMOTE/class weights), model testing (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), evaluate with F1-score and precision.
- Example results: F1-score ≈ 0.76 (example).
- Code & Notebook: loan approval prediction using machine learning.ipynb

## Skills
- Languages & libraries: Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn
- Tools: Jupyter, Git/GitHub, SQL, Docker (basic)
- Topics: classification, feature engineering, model evaluation, cross-validation

## How to run my notebooks
1. Clone the project repository, e.g.:
   git clone https://github.com/reneymay2304/diabetic-readmission.git
2. Create a virtual environment and install requirements:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebook:
   jupyter lab  # or jupyter notebook
