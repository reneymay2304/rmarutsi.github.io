### HR DASHBOARD ANALYTICS 
 It is an HR Analytics Dasboard I made using  PowerBI to provide insights to employee demographics,attrition and job satisfactio.The dashboard reveals key stats: 1,470 employees, 16.12%   attrition rate, and 1,233 active employees. Notably, the R&D department has the highest attrition (38.82%), while the 25-34 age group has the largest employee base (337 males, 196        females). Laboratory Technicians have the highest job satisfaction rating, and Life Sciences has the largest attrition among education groups. This dashboard helps HR make data-driven    decisions on resource allocation, retention strategies, and talent development
