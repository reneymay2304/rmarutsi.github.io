## How to run locally
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/reneymay2304/rmarutsi.github.io.git
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and install packages from `requirements.txt`.
3. Start Jupyter and open the notebook:
   jupyter lab  # or jupyter notebook

## Notes & tip
- Filenames in this repo contain spaces. The links above use the exact filenames already in your repo. For easier linking later, I recommend renaming files to simpler names (lowercase, underscores) and moving them into a `notebooks/` folder (example: `notebooks/diabetic_readmission.ipynb`). If you'd like, I can show exactly how to rename or move them on GitHub.
